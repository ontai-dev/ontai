## Branch Summary

### session/1-governor-init (all repos, merged to main)

Foundation work across all six operators. Established all CRD types, reconcilers,
shared library, admission webhook, bootstrap window, lineage system, CAPI integration,
and Wrapper pack delivery. Platform onboards management cluster via import path.
Guardian CNPG audit sink operational. EPG auto-refresh live. ClusterPack delivery
end-to-end verified. Key invariants closed: INV-020 (bootstrap window), CS-INV-001,
SC-INV-002 (condition vocabulary). enable-ccs-mgmt.sh CI script committed. Commits
across all six repos -- see GIT_TRACKING.md for full log.

### session/2-lineage-sync (seam-core, guardian)

Closed SEAM-CORE-BL-LINEAGE. Root cause: PermissionSnapshot was not a root GVK but
received LineageSynced=False initialization. Fixed by removing erroneous init block
from permissionsnapshot_controller.go. PackInstance test gap closed with new regression
guard. seam-core commit 52de8d3. guardian commit c36ffd3.

### session/3-reconciler-bugs (platform)

Pre-existing guardian envtest FAIL recorded as GUARDIAN-BL-ENVTEST-FAIL (not introduced
by session/3). RetryOnConflict added to TalosClusterReconciler status patch. LocalQueue
creation in seam-tenant for tenant clusters added to platform. CI-SCRIPT backlog item
closed (enable-ccs-mgmt.sh committed).

### session/4-webhook-hardening-and-compiler-fixes (guardian, conductor, platform, ontai root)

**G-BL-CR-IMMUTABILITY (guardian PR #5):**
Operator-authorship guard blocking human UPDATE/PATCH on PackInstance, RunnerConfig,

**C-COREDNS-PATCH (conductor PR #3):**

Commit a0a4c53.

**C-34 (platform PR #4, conductor PR #3):**
TalosClusterSpec.CAPI changed from CAPIConfig to *CAPIConfig. nil pointer suppresses
capi block in YAML when disabled (management cluster path). CAPIEnabled() helper added.

management cluster builders updated, regression test added (commit f7c66ad).

Two Governor directives codified in CLAUDE.md:

## Open Backlog (High Priority)

| ID | Component | Description |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| TENANT-CLUSTER-E2E | all | ccs-dev never onboarded as tenant cluster. Required for alpha. |
| PLATFORM-BL-TENANT-GC | platform | TalosCluster deletion should cascade to seam-tenant namespace. |
| G-BL-CNPG-POOLER-AUTH | guardian | Connect to rw service not pooler. md5 hash caching issue. |
| GUARDIAN-BL-ENVTEST-FAIL | guardian | Integration/webhook envtest fails pre-existing. Investigation needed. |
