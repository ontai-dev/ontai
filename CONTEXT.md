## 4. Next Session

**Role:** Platform Controller Engineer
**Component:** platform

**Platform — TalosCluster reconciler** (bootstrap + CAPI paths). This is the primary remaining Platform workstream. Platform is currently a skeleton (commit 7237416). The TalosCluster reconciler drives cluster lifecycle: bootstrap via Compiler, CAPI integration via SeamInfrastructureClusterReconciler and SeamInfrastructureMachineReconciler (INV-013). Read platform-schema.md and platform/platform-design.md before starting.

**LineageController** — deferred until Platform and Wrapper have meaningful object-producing implementations.

**Pre-conditions (Platform TalosCluster reconciler):**
- platform at 7237416 on branch `session/1-governor-init`
- Read platform-schema.md and platform/platform-design.md in full before any implementation
- conductor Conductor is substantially complete (pull loop, signing, PermissionService all wired)
